## Loading the dataset

We will use the [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library to download the data and get the metric we need to use for evaluation (to compare our model to the benchmark).

Before we can feed those texts to our model, we need to preprocess them. This is done by a ðŸ¤— Transformers `Tokenizer` which will (as the name indicates) tokenize the inputs (including converting the tokens to their corresponding IDs in the pretrained vocabulary) and put it in a format the model expects, as well as generate the other inputs that model requires.

To do all of this, we instantiate our tokenizer with the `AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained` method, which will ensure:

- we get a tokenizer that corresponds to the model architecture we want to use,
- we download the vocabulary used when pretraining this specific checkpoint.

That vocabulary will be cached, so it's not downloaded again the next time we run the cell.
"""

Instead of one sentence, we can pass along a list of sentences:
"""

"""Even better, the results are automatically cached by the ðŸ¤— Datasets library to avoid spending time on this step the next time you run your notebook. The ðŸ¤— Datasets library is normally smart enough to detect when the function you pass to map has changed (and thus requires to not use the cache data). For instance, it will properly detect if you change the task in the first cell and rerun the notebook. ðŸ¤— Datasets warns you when it uses cached files, you can pass `load_from_cache_file=False` in the call to `map` to not use the cached files and force the preprocessing to be applied again.

Note that we passed `batched=True` to encode the texts by batches together. This is to leverage the full benefit of the fast tokenizer we loaded earlier, which will use multi-threading to treat the texts in a batch concurrently.

## Fine-tuning the model

Now that our data is ready, we can download the pretrained model and fine-tune it. Since our task is of the sequence-to-sequence kind, we use the `AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM` class. Like with the tokenizer, the `from_pretrained` method will download and cache the model for us.

To instantiate a `Seq2SeqTrainer`, we will need to define three more things. The most important is the [`Seq2SeqTrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#transformers.Seq2SeqTrainingArguments), which is a class that contains all the attributes to customize the training. It requires one folder name, which will be used to save the checkpoints of the model, and all other arguments are optional:

Since the `Seq2SeqTrainer` will save the model regularly and our dataset is quite large, we tell it to make three saves maximum. Lastly, we use the `predict_with_generate` option (to properly generate summaries) and activate mixed precision training (to go a bit faster).

The last argument to setup everything so we can push the model to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) regularly during training. Remove it if you didn't follow the installation steps at the top of the notebook. If you want to save your model locally in a name that is different than the name of the repository it will be pushed, or if you want to push your model under an organization and not your name space, use the `hub_model_id` argument to set the repo name (it needs to be the full name, including your namespace: for instance `"sgugger/marian-finetuned-en-to-ro"` or `"huggingface/marian-finetuned-en-to-ro"`).
